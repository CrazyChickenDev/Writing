Another year has pasted and it is time to have a look backward to see what has changes, what can adapted and improved.

## Table of Contents

## Finishing business law degree

This year it was time to finish the law degree. The remaining classes, were banking law, civil procedure law and bankruptcy law. All proved to be demanding. Especially banking law was painful. It is important to understand that the content of this law field was very interesting but the organization and grading was poor. Hence I had some thoughts to share. University in my opinion should be a place where the people should help each other to achieve wisdom and knowledge. Too often this is not the case. Academic personel sometimes degenerate into a insufficient examination body without any further help. This was the case with this class. The challenge that I was facing was the unprofessional way of grading and the poor help in learning the material. Surely many people just complain, but this does not lead to anywhere. One aspect for me was to inform the program director of this problematic field. Another aspect was to grow with this experience myself. It classifies as a great example on hardships in life. Very often things do not go the way we expect. This does not necessarily mean that it is just the fault of others, but maybe there are necessary changes on both sides to be made. For me it was identifying what the actual problem is and how I could change to get past it. Because in many situations it is emotion that distract us from seeing the real cause. In my case it was the negative emotion of not getting past the exam. Changing the learning strategy was not enough as the knowledge was not the problem. It was in fact the person who was grading. Hence it was necessary to understand the graders expectations. It was not to test knowledge but to follow a very simple examination scheme. After understanding this, it was doable.

The takeaways from this are:
1. Understand the real cause of a problem by subtracting the emotion.
2. If a person is part of a problem, examine the actions and view of this person.
3. Always be persistent. No matter how often you have to try. Change the way of tackling the problem and adapt accordingly. Like a machine learning algorithm ;)


After finishing the master thesis the master degree was done. Interesting for me was that it did not overwhelm me with feelings of accomplishment or joy. It was just something I had finished after many years of hard work. I think part of the missing joy from this is the very poor response from the job market. It is important to clarify that business law can be a very lucrative and interesting field to work in, but it does not comply to my expectations on how I want to live my life and especially my worklife. This comes from my experiences in working in the tech industry, which seems to be better in nearly all aspects. Better payment, more flexibility in working, more promising companies, more diverse colleagues, better vibes. This is just my current feeling and observations, maybe I have not seen enough to judge this correctly.

Another thing to takeaway was the celebration of the degree. I was celebrating it with friends and family. This showed to be a very nice thing. Even though it was not so important for me personally to have the degree it was to family members and friends. Hence the celebration was for them. Fulfilling their expectations and hopes is a nice thing and creates some satisfaction.

## Evaluating the jobmarket and company experiences

This is something every graduate has to do at least once in his life. Evaluating your value in the job market, selling yourself and getting to work with a nice company to fulfill your dreams.

As mentioned above this showed me that the legal sector has limited positive things to offer. It is a saturated and very competitive market. There are many law graduates. Many have similar backgrounds and the lawfirms take just the very best of them. As the law itself and especially the career path for becoming an attorney are very strict and tied to the country, it forces graduates to comply to a heavily regulated system. For complying individuals this is no problem. It is difficult for the ones, that have unique ways of seeing, changing and improving things. And this is the main issue for me. Complying with antique standards, avoiding change as much as possible and treating everyone the same. In my experience the legal sector has a tendency to go in exactly this direction, which is not very appealing.

Apart from this observation I was also able to collect insights in firms and also in many application processes.

Takeaways are:
1. Apply for many many postions and start as much as possible. This is the only way to identify your own strengths and needs for a job and also gives you a good overview of the market.
2. Do not accept a job that does not fit to your values. This is the number one factor for unhappiness in your life. Work makes up a big part of your life. You should enjoy it to the fullest and not accept the view of people telling you otherwise. Most of the time they are unsatisfied with it on their own and want to pull you down to their shit.
3. Constantly challenge yourself and your standards for work. We live in the year 2019. There are ways of making a ton of money by just putting pictures on the internet. This should remind you that everything  is constantly evolving and changing. There is no need for doing a 9 to 5 job and doing repetitive stupid work over a long period of time. If you find yourself in a situation like this, leave.
4. Evaluate if a conflict provides an opportunity. In job life one thing that keeps you from getting more or better is the fear of conflict. Avoiding unpleasant situations is a normal tendency but limits your growth (depending on the conflict itself). Therefore evaluate if a conflict is necessary to push you in the right direction. And if so, face it.


## Starting another study

This year I started the Artificial Intelligence studies at JKU. I dreamed of going into more statistics and programming on an academic level. Now I was able to start this journey for new knowledge.

Key takeaways:
1. Try many things. I think it is always good to start with many ideas and narrowing down on what you like. Same with university. There is of course always an organizational overload, but it is necessary to keep yourself in a developing process. Finishing one interlectual field is not enough in my opinion. Life is about challenging yourself as much as possible. Today we have much information available and knowing things in just one area is just not enough anymore. There are too many competitive people around. You have to be good and diverse to be on top I think.

## Adapting a chilled mindset

One of the very most important realizations for me this year was on how to adapt a more chilled mindset. Looking on my past years I always tried to do as much as possible and also challenge myself as much as possible. I often did this with only having the goal in mind. The goal was always more important to me than the process and also my own being. But from an efficiency perspective this is wrong in many ways.
First thing is that we can only control a small fraction of what happens around us. We can go in a direction, but most of things will happen independently from our will. So this already helps in understanding that our actions have a small effect on the expectations we set us for ourself. Therefore we can have a rather relaxed feeling about pursuing goals.
The second thing is that very, very often we do not set our own expectations but rather take expectations of others and make it our own expectations. This is very difficult to understand, so I want to illustrate it with an example from a day-to-day situation from a job:

The boss wants you to finish a project in three days. He has sold this idea to clients. He sets the expectations for the clients, himself, the company and ultimately you. You try to do your best, but it is not enough to finish it. There is the demand to work overtime and sacrifice your sparetime in order to get it done. You had already relaxations plans instead of doing more work. You comply with the demand and do overtime. The project is finished poorly because of the mismanaged expectation and time. The client is not satisfied. Therefore the boss is not satisfied. He blames you as you did not perform well enough.You get sick because you did not hear to yourself and your body as you needed relaxation.
This illustrative example happens so often to people around me, it is crazy.
My developed mindset now is to not comply with the demand of doing overtime. Overtime is often poor management from the executive layer of a company. In the end it is almost always a lose-lose situation. There are situations were it is fruitful and good to do overtime. This is the case when the project is demanding and the employee is motivated and wants to stretch. The employee starts from a solid healthy foundation and challenges himself with more work to grow. This is ideal. But this rarely happens. I feel like 90% of the people overdo it because other people demand it from them and then they get sick. Fear of conflict and fear of losing the job keeps them in this unsatisfying situation.
Having a relaxed mindset for this and going home when it is enough for you is both brave and efficient. Better to have very motivated, healthy and rested employees then grinding them out and having them leave.
