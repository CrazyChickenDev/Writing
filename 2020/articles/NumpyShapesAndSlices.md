As data scientist / machine learning engineer it is necessary to deal with many Numpy arrays. Sometimes in the process I lose overview about all shaping and indexing syntax, so here is an overview.


## Shapes and Dimensions

#### Shape 1 Dim

#### Shape 3 Dim

## Arranging

## Indexing

#### Index with slice

#### Indexing 2 dim array

#### Indexing 3 dim array

The same principles for more dimensional arrays:
####  Indexing 4 dim array
