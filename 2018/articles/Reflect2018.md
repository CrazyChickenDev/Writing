2018 was a very fast year. To revisit a few things that had happened and evaluate their value it is useful to write them out. It also helps to inform other people I cannot spend so much time with to update them. :)

## Goals 2018

Some of my goals for 2018 were:

- Keep progress at university
- Keep organization of non-profit
- Get into machine learning
- Get another job for new experiences
- Keep cold shower
- Stay sporty

## University / Business Law

This was a quite good year in terms of university progress. Lecturewise I was focusing on
- Criminal Procedure Law
- Company and Capital Markets Law
- European Law
- Labour Law
- Tax Law
- Inheritance Law
- Principles of International Law
- Constitutional Law
- Banking Law

There were some negative results in the first term but this was due to the limited time available and "ambitious" workload in general.
What I had realized this year, especially with university duties, is that one is more capable of things than you would imagine at first. We are really able to stretch according to the tasks that are thrown at us. This is essentially what makes us grow. Demanding more than we are capable of in the first place. And this was the case with all law related endeavors this year. Once again the Pareto Principle showed its value.

## Non-profit work

As there was not much time available I need to trim down efforts on organizing events. Surprisingly it turned out to still work well enough to continue them. Of course, this is also due to the great work of my co-organizer Robert Axelsen, but I was surprised that it kept going. It also showed the main value of the events, which is not really the organized content, but rather the exchange of people.

We need to change some things I think. We should keep identifying strengths and build on them.
Additionally, we need people. One or 2 persons can only do so much. To really change something, to make dreams a reality, we need to work together. Everyone can contribute with a little, and that is how we can build something that stands the test of time.

## Getting into machine learning

This technological discovery is something that can really change a lot in my opinion. Therefore I wanted to get into it. I did the online courses from Stanford about Machine Learning and Deep Learning, and was amazed by its power.
Unfortunately, and I really came to realize this in my next job, it takes a lot, really A LOT, to be sufficient and productive with it. All the math in the background, all the statistics, all the programming specific additions need a lot of knowledge. As Liad Magen, one of my colleagues, said: "If you don't understand the tools you are working with, you are not more then a kid playing with lego". Even though it was always clear to me it was good to hear it from time to time.

Hence, I decided to focus first on finishing my Masters degree in law before going into depth with machine learning. It does hurt to not pursue the most interesting things at a time, but it is of no good use if you are doing too much and not in depth. I though I can just do it on the side, like my university studies, but this was wrong. Building on a foundation on the side is doable. Building something on the side that requires that much attention is not doable.

Focus is key.

## Getting another job

Life is about growth. The more experiences one is able to collect, the more he is able to contribute to challenges of life. Therefore I wanted to experience another company additionally to my current job as a web developer. It was quite easy as there is always a high demand on people that are able to learn and have an opitmistic mindset.
